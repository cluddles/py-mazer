Python maze solver with tcl/tk visualisation

Requires python3 with `tkinter` module

Has quite a few limitations, including (but not limited to):
* Maze solver uses depth-first search rather than anything more optimal (breadth-first search, A*, whatever)
* It's pretty ugly
* You can't close the window until everything has finished
* Did I mention that it's ugly?
